JEC LMS- Library management system is an enterprise resource planning software that helps us manage all the in-house activities of a library. The system helps to maintain a database about the books present in the library and their authors, the readers to whom the book has been issued, who borrowed the book as well as who returned the book. The system charges a small amount of fine on being late while returning the book that has been borrowed. The system also keeps the record of the visitors who visits the library. All these activities done by human manually in a day sometimes causes human-error. So to avoid such errors made by human we choose to depend on the modern day technology. The modern day technology has grown so rapidly that it has made humans to depend on it and work more efficiently. Thus, the project on “JEC Library Management System” is designed to computerize and automate the operations performed over the activities included in a library which will help in many instances of its maintenance
